# This is an academic project on predicting credit risk and default payment
## during this project I have worked on the following:<br>
* Creating an end to end machine learning application for banking systems
that identifies whether a customer will make a default payment In the
following month based on their payments and bill statements for the past
six months.
* Deploying the model on a web platform to display the prediction results.
